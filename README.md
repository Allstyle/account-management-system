# Account Management System Demo

- Participated in developing an application to manage employees' account information for the internal use of the company.
- Connected to the Oracle 11g database using Hibernate in the data layer, worked on the annotation based mapping and transaction methods. 
- Get data from the server by making AJAX calls in the front-end and built the RESTful web services in the back-end to expose the resources.
- Built the web pages using HTML, Bootstrap and implemented the control flow with AngularJS. 
- Used Maven for the dependency management and build process.

Note: This demo project is very differnt from the real system in use, it's for learning and reference purpose only.
